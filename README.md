# Face_Recognition
A simple face recognising model which is created using open_cv and numpy
This model was trained with various celebrity photos of famous hollywood celebrities and it uses the functionality of the cascade files of the open_cv library which was made by Intel to recognise the face of each celebrity.It was one of my capstone project. So, feel free to check it out :)
